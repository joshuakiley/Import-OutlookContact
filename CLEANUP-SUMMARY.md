### 📁 Organized Remaining Files

#### Root Directory (Core Entry Points)

- `Import-OutlookContact.ps1` ✅ (Main application entry point)
- `Start-ImportOutlookContact.ps1` ✅ (Startup script)

#### Scripts Directory (`/scripts/`)

- `Import-CSVWithDuplicateHandling.ps1` ✅ (Main utility - moved & renamed)
- `Setup-Environment.ps1` ✅ (Environment setup)
- `Test-Authentication.ps1` ✅ (Auth testing)
- `Test-Prerequisites.ps1` ✅ (Requirements validation)
- `README.md` ✅ (Documentation)

#### Test Directory (`/test/`)

- Formal test files remain organized for CI/CD

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Cleaner Root Directory**

- Reduced from ~20 .ps1 files to just 2 core entry points
- Eliminated confusion about which scripts to use

### 2. **Organized Scripts**

- All utility scripts now in `/scripts/` with clear names
- Each script has a specific, documented purpose
- No more script name conflicts or confusion

### 3. **Generic CSV Import**

- `comprehensive-csv-import.ps1` → `Import-CSVWithDuplicateHandling.ps1`
- Works with ANY CSV file (not just AMI-specific)
- Folder name = CSV filename (e.g., "ECS.csv" → "ECS" folder)

### 4. **Better Documentation**

- Updated main README.md with organized CLI examples
- Created scripts/README.md with usage guide for each utility
- Clear separation between entry points and utilities

## 🚀 New Recommended Workflow

### For CSV Imports:

```powershell
# Import any CSV file with interactive duplicate handling
pwsh ./scripts/Import-CSVWithDuplicateHandling.ps1 "./csv-files/your-file.csv"
```

### For First-Time Setup:

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/Setup-Environment.ps1
pwsh ./scripts/Test-Prerequisites.ps1
pwsh ./scripts/Test-Authentication.ps1
```

### For Traditional CLI Operations:

```powershell
pwsh ./Import-OutlookContact.ps1 -Mode BulkAdd -CsvPath ./contacts.csv
```

## 📊 File Count Summary

- **Before:** ~20+ .ps1 files scattered in root
- **After:** 2 entry points in root + 4 organized utilities in scripts/
- **Removed:** 15 debug/test files that served their purpose
- **Net Result:** 75% reduction in root directory clutter

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Easier Navigation** - Clear separation of concerns
2. **Better Maintainability** - Each script has a single responsibility
3. **User-Friendly** - Clear documentation and usage examples
4. **Professional Structure** - Industry-standard project organization
5. **Reduced Confusion** - No more guessing which script to use

The project is now much cleaner and more professional! 🎉
